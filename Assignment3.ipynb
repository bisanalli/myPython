    "   here few advantages of function \n",
    "A.Code Reusability: Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions into a reusable block of code. Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times from different parts of your program.\n",
    "B.Modularity: Functions promote modularity by breaking down your code into smaller, self-contained units. Each function performs a specific task or operation, making your code more organized and easier to understand.\n",
    "C.Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away complex implementation details. By defining a function with a meaningful name and providing a well-defined interface.\n",
    "D.Readability: Functions enhance the readability of your code by giving meaningful names to blocks of code. Well-named functions make your code self-explanatory and easier to understand.\n",
    "E.Testing and Debugging: Functions facilitate testing and debugging. You can write test cases specifically for individual functions to verify their correctness. By isolating functions, you can debug them independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",
    "F.Code Organization: Functions help organize your code by grouping related functionality together. By dividing your program into smaller functions, you can focus on specific tasks at a time, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.\n",

    "Function: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or a set of related tasks. It is defined using the def statement in Python. Functions have a name, can have parameters (optional), and may have a return value (also optional). They encapsulate a set of instructions that can be executed when the function is called.\n",

    "Function Call: A function call refers to the actual execution of a function at a specific point in a program. When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses () that may contain arguments or parameters (if the function expects any). The function call causes the execution of the code within the function's code block. Once the function completes its task or reaches a return statement, the control flow returns to the point of the function call.\n",
